# Always 3 Interests

## About
Duplicants always have 3 interests when they are selected.
You no longer have to re-mix for half an hour to get strong duplicants!

## Details
CUSTOMIZE:
You can change the number of interests of new duplicants by modifying the file: 
steamapps\common\OxygenNotIncluded\Mods\Always3Interests\Config\Always3InterestsState.json
Open it with a text editor (notepad or others) and change the value of 3.
Do not put a value greater than 5.
